## Completed Test/Backup Visualizations

* categorical factors affect heart disease among different age ranges:
  - design:
    1. bar diagram: normalization to show perception instead of using count directly
  - obeservation:
      1. exercise habits & heart disease: less exercise higher prob for people under 40; more exercise higher prob for people over 50+ (not very accurate)
      2. no significance relation between exercise and age by ANOVA
      3. female have higher prob to suffer heart disease than man among all age ranges
      4. high LDL Cholesterol seriously affect old people's heart health (over 70)
      5. medium stress level most likely to cause heart disease among all ages (counter-intuitive)
      6. high sugar consumption most likely to cause heart disearse among young and middle age (before 50)
      7. There is a significant relationship between Stress Level and Heart Disease by chi-square
      8. sleep hours have no significant effect on heart disease by t-test
      9. sleep hours and stress level has no significant relation by ANOVA
      10. alcohol consumption significantly affects the heart disease rate between gender
      11. Stress Levels, Cholesterol Levels, and BMI seem to be the most important indicators of heart disease
